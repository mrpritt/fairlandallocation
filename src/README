Compiling:
'make': compile with -O2, verbosity and soft assertions. Should be used during development.
'make debug': same as make, but with the HARD_DEBUG defined, which enables time-consuming assertions.
'make release': non-verbose, -O3, no assertions. Should be used for the release build.

Program options: see ./proterra --help
